/**
 * FOREWORD:
 *
 * To avoid ambiguity and for simplified readability:
 *
 *  - the term "user" shall refer to people who download the app and buy
 *    products or subscriptions.
 *
 *  - the term "client" shall refer to those developers/engineers on the team who depend on the
 *    billing repository as an API.
 *
 * OVERVIEW:
 *
 * A solid In-App Billing implementation depends on purchase confirmation data from three different
 * data sources: the Google Play Billing service, a secure server, and the app's own local cache.
 * Naturally a repository module is needed to manage all these different data sources and
 * associated operations so that the rest of the app can access this data effortlessly. Let this
 * module be called [BillingRepository]. And -- on behalf of the rest of the app -- it shall handle
 * all interactions with the _Play Billing Library_, the billing portions of a secure server,
 * and the billing portions of the app’s local cache.
 *
 * What the rest of the app gets, then, is a simple API in the form of a ViewModel that comprises:
 * a list of inventory (i.e. what’s for sale); a purchase function (i.e. how to buy); and a set
 * of entitlements (i.e. what the user owns). Hence, for the rest of the app the complexities and
 * nuances of _Play Billing_ become nonexistent. All distinctions such as managed vs consumable
 * products vs subscriptions etc. fall out of sight and therefore out of mind.
 *
 * What this means, on the other hand, is that all the work is now concentrated in one module,
 * namely the [BillingRepository]. And this repository shall know exactly everything the app
 * is selling and how. And the app should not be selling anything that's not listed in this
 * repository. Therefore, the engineers responsible for implementing the [BillingRepository]
 * need to fully understand the app's business model.
 *
 * Figure 1 shows the app from the perspective of the billing module.

 *
 * DATA DYNAMICS
 *
 * It’s important to consider data mechanics when designing a feature as crucial as the
 * app’s billing repository. Where the billing data rests and how it flows through the repository
 * are central aspects of the design that should not be left to chance or the mysterious voodoos
 * of evolution. Figure 2 depicts an approach that streamlines the flow of data through the repo.
 *
 * 1. [launchBillingFlow] and [queryPurchasesAsync] can be called directly from the client:
 *   [launchBillingFlow] may be triggered by a button click when the user wants to buy something;
 *   [queryPurchasesAsync] may be triggered by a pull-to-refresh or an [Activity] lifecycle event.
 *   Hence, they are the starting points in the process.
 *
 * 2. [onPurchasesUpdated] is the callback that the Play [BillingClient] calls in response to its
 *    [launcBillingFlow][BillingClient.launchBillingFlow] being called. Typically, developers are
 *    recommended to do work inside this method. In this scalable architecture, however, the
 *    following recommendation is made: If the response code is [BillingResponse.OK], then
 *    developers may go straight to [processPurchases]. If however the response code is
 *    [BillingResponse.ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED], then developers should call [queryPurchasesAsync] to
 *    verify if other such already-owned items exist that should be processed.
 *
 * 3. The [queryPurchasesAsync] method grabs data from Play's [BillingClient] and from the secure
 *    server's billing client and merges that data into the local cache billing client after
 *    performing three-way verification on the data for security. It always does this so that
 *    even if a purchase was not made through this app, and was not made through Google Play,
 *    as long as the secure server knows about said purchase, this method will grab it for the
 *    app instance. Calling Play's [BillingClient] is cheap; it involves no network calls since
 *    Play stores the data in its own local cache. But calling the secure server billing client
 *    does involve network calls. Therefore, measures must be taken to [throttle][Throttle] that
 *    portion of the flow (i.e. [queryPurchasesFromSecureServer]).
 *
 * 4. Finally, all data that end up as part of the public interface of the [BillingRepository],
 *    i.e. in the [BillingViewModel] and therefore in other portions of the app, come immediately
 *    from the local cache billing client. The local cache is backed by a Room database and all
 *    the data visible to the clients is wrapped in [LiveData] so that changes are reflected in
 *    the clients as soon as they happen.
 *

 *
 * FINAL THOUGHT
 *
 * While the architecture presented here and 95% of the code is highly reusable (that's the whole
 * point of a sample), this repository nonetheless will always be app-specific. For
 * Trivial Drive, for example, it will be tailored to sell three items: a premium car, gas
 * for driving, and "gold status." Consequently, this repo must handle logic that
 * deals with what it means for a user to own a premium car or buy gas. To say it differently:
 * For your own app, this repo shall know exactly everything the app is selling and how. And the
 * app should not be selling anything that's not listed in this repo. Therefore, the engineers
 * responsible for implementing the [BillingRepository] need to fully understand the app's business
 * model.
 *
 * P.S.
 *
 * While subscription [BillingClient.SkuType.SUBS] is mentioned in this app, Google Play offers a
 * wealth of subscription-specific features that aren't addressed here. But you can learn about them
 * in the Classy Taxi sample app.

     * In addition to the Play billing client, there may need to have a secure server billing client
     * if the platform in question provides the user multiple avenues for purchasing premium
     * content. Examples of such avenues include the web or another mobile OS besides Android.
     * So if, for instance, the user makes some purchases through iOS and some purchases through
     * Android, then the Play Store may not know everything the user owns. Therefore, in order to
     * give the user access to all their entitlements on Android, the secure server would be
     * consulted.
     *
     * Security is, of course, an important consideration of the billing repo’s architecture.
     * So in addition to the aforementioned cases, there may still want to have a secure server
     * billing client for an additional level of security, such as signature verification.
     * Understanding this, Play Billing provides a server-to-server interface through which all
     * purchases made on Android can be verified.
     *
     * Therefore, an app’s own secure server is always ideally the best place to check for billing
     * data. Nevertheless, there may be times when the secure server is unavailable either for
     * maintenance or because the user has no internet access. For this reason, verifying purchases

    /**
     * BACKGROUND
     *
     * Play Billing refers to receipts as [Purchases][Purchase]. So when a user buys something,
     * Play Billing returns a [Purchase] object that the app then uses to release the actual
     * [Entitlement] to the user. Receipts are pivotal within the [BillingRepositor]; but they are
     * not part of the repo’s public API because clients don’t need to know about them
     * (clients don’t need to know anything about billing).  At what moment the release of
     * entitlements actually takes place depends on the type of purchase. For consumable products,
     * the release may be deferred until after consumption by Play; for non-consumable products and
     * subscriptions, the release may be immediate. It is convenient to keep receipts in the local
     * cache for augmented security and for making some transactions easier.
     *
     * THIS METHOD
     *
     * [This method][queryPurchasesAsync] grabs all the active purchases of this user and makes them
     * available to this app instance. Whereas this method plays a central role in the billing
     * system, it should be called liberally both within this repo and by clients. With that in
     * mind, the implementation must be assiduous in managing communication with data sources and in
     * processing the correlations amongst data types.
     *
     * Because purchase data is vital to the rest of the app, this method gets a call each time
     * the [BillingViewModel] successfully establishes connection with the Play [BillingClient]:
     * the call comes through [onBillingSetupFinished]. Recall also from Figure 2 that this method
     * gets called from inside [onPurchasesUpdated] in order not only to streamline the flow of
     * purchase data but also to seize on the opportunity to grab purchases from all possible
     * sources (i.e. Play and secure server).
     *
     * This method works by first grabbing both INAPP and SUBS purchases from the Play Store.
     * Then it checks if there is any new purchase (i.e. not yet recorded in the local cache).
     * If there are new purchases: it sends them to server for verification and safekeeping,
     * and it saves them in the local cache. But if there are no new purchases, it calls the
     * secure server to check for purchases there.
     *
     * Calls should not be made to the secure server too often -- it's co$tly. Instead calls should
     * be made at intervals, such as only allow calls at least 2 hours apart. On the one hand,
     * it is not good that users should not have access on Android to purchases they made through
     * another OS; on the other hand, it is not good to be paying too much to hosting companies
     * because the secure servers is being hit too often just to check for new purchases --
     * unless users are actually buying items very often across multiple devices.
     *
     * In this sample, the variables lastInvocationTime and DEAD_BAND are used to
     * [throttle][Throttle] calls to the secure server. lastInvocationTime could be persisted in
     * [Room]; here, [SharedPreferences] is used.

     * cleanup the local cache with data from the server.

     * Pathway 2:
     *
     * {clients} -> [queryPurchasesAsync] -> [queryPurchasesFromSecureServer]:
     *
     * In this scenario, someone other than Play has triggered the flow; perhaps a pull-to-refresh?

     * on the secure server for purchases that Play is possibly not aware of. However, for calls
     * coming through this pathway, it is advisable to apply a [throttle][Throttle] so to not hit
     * the secure server too often.

    /**
     * Recall that Play Billing only supports two SKU types:

     * to actual items that a user can buy, such as a house or food; while subscriptions refer to
     * services that a user must pay for regularly, such as auto-insurance. Naturally subscriptions
     * are not consumable -- it's not like you can eat your auto-insurance policy.
     *
     * Play Billing provides methods for consuming in-app products because they understand that
     * apps may sell items that users will keep forever (i.e. never consume) such as a house,
     * and items that users will need to keep buying such as food. Nevertheless, Play leaves the
     * distinction for which in-app products are consumable vs non-consumable entirely up to you.
     * In other words, inside your app you have the godlike power to decide whether it's logical for
     * people to eat their houses and live in their hotdogs or vice versa. BUT: once you tell
     * the Play Store to consume an in-app product, Play no longer tracks that purchase. Hence,
     * the app must implement logic here and on the secure server to track consumable items.
     *
     * So why would an app tell the Play Store to consume an item? That's because Play won't let
     * users buy items they already bought but haven't consumed. So if an app wants its users to
     * be able to keep buying an item, it must call [BillingClient.consumeAsync] each time they
     * buy it. In Trivial Drive for example consumeAsync is called each time the user buys gas;
     * otherwise they would never be able to buy gas or drive again once the tank becomes empty.
